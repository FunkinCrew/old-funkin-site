this is for funkin website stuff
if you're compiling game, you can ignore this folder completely!

if not, dawg check out [funkin.me](https://funkin.me)

note that i probably won't accept any major pull requests for this
cuz I wanna make the website as a nice lil project to teach myself HTML and CSS and all that!!
